What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable is y which is "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
What variable(s) are the feature(s) for your model?
Feature variabke is X which consists of all colums expect "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
"ENI" and "NAME" columns are removed
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Initally started off with 2 layers and with neuron count was 30 since acurracy score not reaching 75% increated the layers and neurons
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
My model reached accuracy score of 73% in 2nd attempt if I increase layers anbd neurons accuracy score will imporve
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
I have increased layers and neurons to increase model performance
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
Not major diffrence between the 2 models accuracy, can increase accuracy score by adding too many layers and neurons also might impact system performance
